Square the edges and ends of the flat. \nFlip the brisket over and trim the top fat cap to about 1/4 of an inch thickness across the surface of the brisket.\n\n2)  In a mixing bowl or empty spice container, mix the salt, pepper, and garlic. Share over the brisket to evenly distribute the spices on all sides.\n\n3)  Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees F using indirect heat and hardwood smoke. \nPlace the brisket on the smoker with the point end facing your main heat source. \nThis is a thicker part of the brisket and it can handle the additional heat. \nClose the lid and smoke until and internal thermometer reads 165 degrees F (usually takes around 8 hours).\n\n4)  On a large work surface, roll out a big piece of butcher paper (or foil) and center your brisket in the middle.\nWrap the brisket by folding edge over edge, creating a leak proof seal all the way around. \nReturn the wrapped brisket to the smoker, seam side down so the weight from the brisket crimps the edges of the paper wrap down tight.\n\n5)  Close the lid on the smoker and, maintaining 225 degrees F, continue cooking until the internal temperature of the brisket reaches 202 degrees F in the thickest part of the meat \n(takes anywhere from 5-8 hours).\n\n6)  Remove the brisket to a large cutting board and allow to rest for 1 hour before slicing. \n\n7)  Slice both the point and the flat against the grain with a sharp knife and serve immediately."
