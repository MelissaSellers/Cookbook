Cold briskets are much easier to work with. \nFlip your brisket over so the point end is underneath. Remove any silver skin or excess fat from the flat muscle. \nTrim down the large crescent moon shaped fat section until it is a smooth transition between the point and the flat. \nTrim and excessive or loose meat and fat from the point. Square the edges and ends of the flat. \nFlip the brisket over and trim the top fat cap to about 1/4 of an inch thickness across the surface of the brisket.\n\n2)  In a mixing bowl or empty spice container, mix the salt, pepper, and garlic. Share over the brisket to evenly distribute the spices on all sides.\n\n3)  Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees F using indirect heat and hardwood smoke. \nPlace the brisket on the smoker with the point end facing your main heat source. \nThis is a thicker part of the brisket and it can handle the additional heat. \nClose the lid and smoke until and internal thermometer reads 165 degrees F (usually takes around 8 hours).\n\n4)  On a large work surface, roll out a big piece of butcher paper (or foil) and center your brisket in the middle.\nWrap the brisket by folding edge over edge, creating a leak proof seal all the way around. \nReturn the wrapped brisket to the smoker, seam side down so the weight from the brisket crimps the edges of the paper wrap down tight.\n\n5)  Close the lid on the smoker and, maintaining 225 degrees F, continue cooking until the internal temperature of the brisket reaches 202 degrees F in the thickest part of the meat \n(takes anywhere from 5-8 hours).\n\n6)  Remove the brisket to a large cutting board and allow to rest for 1 hour before slicing. \n\n7)  Slice both the point and the flat against the grain with a sharp knife and serve immediately."

    "recipeText": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWash 3-4 large peaches and chop them into bite sized pieces or slices (you'll need about 2 and a half cups of chopped or thinly sliced peaches to cover the cake.). Set them aside in a bowl while you prepare the cake batter.\n\nAdd the butter and the sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer and beat them together until the mixture is fluffy and becomes a pale colour (about 4-5 minutes). It's important that the butter is at room temperature before you begin. This will allow it to integrate properly with the other wet ingredients.\nFeel free to use a hand mixer if you prefer.\n\nAdd the eggs and the vanilla and beat them in on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It's a good idea to scrape down the bowl periodically to make sure everything is incorporated evenly.\n\nAdd the milk and sour cream and beat in these ingredients on low speed until they're combined.\n\nTo a separate bowl add the flour, the baking powder and the salt and mix these ingredients together with a fork or a wire whisk. Once they're all incorporated, dump the flour mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer with the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and watch the batter come together. As soon as you see the batter form with streaks of flour throughout, turn off the mixer and remove the bowl.\n\nOver-mixing at this stage can cause an overly dense and dry cake with large air bubbles, which you definitely don't want. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl by hand and gently fold in the remaining flour. Be sure to stop folding as soon as everything is combined.\n\nGrease a 9x13 rectangular glass cake pan (or a metal pan) with some butter and pour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to push the batter into the corners and even out the surface. Don't worry, the batter will seem thick but it's supposed to be like that.\n\nSpread the peaches over the top of the batter.\n\nIn a clean bowl mix together the flour, sugar and cinnamon for the streusel topping. Add in the melted butter and mix everything together with a fork until the mixture becomes crumbly.\n\nSprinkle the streusel mixture over the cake and the peaches, making sure to spread it at evenly as possible and into all the corners.\n\nBake the cake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 47-50 minutes. When it's finished baking the topping will be slightly browned on top, the fruit will be bubbly, and when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake it will come out clean.\n\nLet the cake cool for at least 25 minutes before slicing."

Stir in the salt, followed by the remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a sticky dough forms.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is elastic, just barely tacky, and springy to the touch, about 10 minutes. \nTransfer to the greased bowl, cover lightly with plastic wrap, and let sit until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\n\nPunch the dough down in the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and roll out to about 1/2 inch thick. \nUsing a 2 1/2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut the dough into 18 rounds. \nYou will need to re-roll the dough once. Evenly spread the dough rounds out between the two prepared baking sheets. \nCover lightly with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\n\nMeanwhile, heat the oven to 375 degrees and make the filling and the streusel. \n\nTo make the cream cheese filling: Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and sugar on low speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. \nAdd the egg yolk, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Continue to beat on low speed, scraping down the sides as necessary, until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nTo make the streusel: In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and cinnamon. Cut the butter into the flour mixture and, using your hands, mix thoroughly to form a sandy meal.\n\nOnce the dough rounds have poofed, use your fingers to create an indentation in the center of each round, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. \nPlace about a tablespoon of filling in the center of each round. \nBrush the edges of the rounds with about half of the remaining melted butter and sprinkle with the streusel.\n\nBake until golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes.

    "ingredientList": "2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice (or cardamom)\n1 medium pear, peeled, cored, and diced\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n1 cup buttermilk, cold  (1 TBSP lemon juice or white distilled vinegar, and enough milk to make 1 cup)\n1 tablespoon heavy cream",
    "recipeText": "In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom together. \n\nCut the butter into the flour using a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingertips. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Gently fold in the pears.\n\nWhisk the vanilla and buttermilk together and gradually add it to the flour mixture. Stir just until the dough comes together. You may not need all the buttermilk. Add a little at a time until the mixture is moist but not too wet. Do not over mix the dough or the scones will be tough.\n\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead the dough four or five times. Pat the dough into a 7-inch round circle.\n\nCut the circle in half, then cut each half into four triangle-shaped wedges. Arrange the scones 2 inches apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the scones in the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\nPosition the oven rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of the scones with cream. \nBake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and drizzle with glaze. Scones are best enjoyed right away.\n\n\n\nNotes\nDon't add all the liquid at once. Depending on the humidity and the brand of flour you are using, you may need less liquid than what is called for. Add just enough to moisten the dry ingredients until they hold together when squeezed.\n\nDice the pear into small pieces. Smaller pieces will make it easier to cut the dough into triangles.\n\nMake sure butter and milk are cold when adding it to the recipe.\n\nFreeze the shaped scones for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the scones keep their shape and ensures the butter isn't too warm before going into the oven.\n\nThis recipe yields 8 large scones. For smaller scones, cut the dough into 16 pieces instead of 8. Watch the scones closely as they bake because smaller scones may require a shorter baking time.\n\nMake Ahead Tip\nYou can refrigerate the dough overnight then simply shape the scones and bake them the next day.\nThe dough can also be frozen for up to 2 months. Freeze the dough on a baking sheet as directed in step 5 then wrap in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag. When ready to make the scones, preheat the oven and baked as directed. There's no need to thaw the dough.\nYou can keep leftover scones for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.\nUnglazed scones can be frozen for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight then reheat and glaze before serving.\n\nButtermilk is a favored product in high altitude baking because it contribute acidity as well as richness, moisture, flavor, and tenderness. If a sea-level recipe calls for regular milk, you can replace it with buttermilk. Acidity weakens the elasticity and/or strength of gluten in wheat flour, thereby keeping baked products tender."

    "recipeText": "1.  For the scones: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.\n\n2.  Sift together the flour, granulated sugar and baking powder. Cut the cold butter into pats, then use a pastry cutter or 2 knives to cut the butter into the flour mixture.

Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture with a fork or spatula just until the dough comes together.\n\n4.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle (the mixture will be pretty crumbly). Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12 inches by 7 inches and 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical rectangles, first cutting lengthwise into 3 strips and then across into 4 strips. Next, cut each rectangle in half diagonally, to form 2 triangles. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets.\n\n5.  Bake until cooked through but not yet golden, about 16 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.\n\nBake scones right before you plan to enjoy them. If you'd like to get ahead, you can make and shape the dough into scones ahead of time and leave them in the fridge overnight. Or you can freeze them on a baking sheet, transfer the frozen unbaked scones to a zip-top bag, and bake them straight from frozen, adding a couple of minutes to the baking time\n\n6.  For the lemon glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, lemon zest and juice and salt until completely smooth, adding more milk if needed for thinning.\n\n7.  Dip the scones in the glaze, then sprinkle with poppy seeds. Allow the glaze to set completely before serving.  "

Broccoli is packed with fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C.\n\nCauliflower.\n\nBrussels Sprouts.\n\nVegetable, Canola, or Olive Oil\n\nSeasonings – see below.",
    "recipeText": "ROASTING THE VEGETABLES\n\n• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n• If needed, coat baking sheet with non-stick spray. If using a good pan, this is not necessary.\n\n• Place cut vegetables in a great big bowl or zip-top bag.\n\n• Top with oil and sprinkle with seasoning. Toss to coat.\n\n• Pay special attention to the broccoli florets and make sure they get an adequate amount of oil, as they are more prone to burning.\n\n• Spread the vegetables into a single layer with a bit of space. Divide the vegetables evenly between two sheets if needed.\n\n• Roast the vegetables at 400 degrees F. for 25 minutes.\n\n• Toss the vegetables halfway through.\n\n• Enjoy hot or at room temperature, with additional salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\nSEASONINGS\n• Cavender’s Greek Seasoning\n• Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning\n• Garlic - salt, pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic).\n• Italian Seasoning\n• Rosemary\n• Dijon Mustard\n• Parmesan. A finishing sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\n• Spicy - Season with 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder (more if you like super spicy!), or regular chili powder plus cayenne.\n• Cheesy - Sprinkle with freshly grated cheddar, mozzarella, gruyere, or Parmesan cheese. Add after roasting. Pop back into the oven for a few minutes to melt.\n• Citrus - Add thin lemon slices or orange slices to the pan. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or orange juice.\n• Pesto - Reduce the olive oil. Toss the vegetables in store-bought or homemade pesto.\n• Honey - 1 tablespoon honey and an extra pinch of salt. Line your baking sheet with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Curry - Season with curry powder and a touch of cumin.\n• Balsamic - 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar prior to roasting. Line the pan with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Mediterranean - Season with oregano and a touch of red wine vinegar. Add sliced olives to the pan. Sprinkle with feta cheese and top with a squeeze of lemon juice prior to serving.\n\nCUTTING VEGETABLES FOR ROASTING\nIf you are mixing different vegetables on the pan, you will want to make sure they finish cooking in the same amount of time. Here are some tips:\n\n• Round Root Vegetables (Beets, Sweet Potatoes, Potatoes). Cut these vegetables on the smaller size (about 3/4-inch pieces), as they tend to take longer to roast.\n\n• Long Root Vegetables (Carrots, Parsnips). Similarly, these veggies take longer to roast. Cut any thick ones in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch slices.\n\n• Cruciferous Vegetables (Brussels Sprouts, Cauliflower, Broccoli). Cut Brussels sprouts in half, and remove the stems. Cut broccoli and cauliflower stems into small rectangular pieces, and slice florets into pieces that are about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick and 1 1/2- to 2-inches wide.\n\n• Soft Vegetables (Green Beans, Asparagus). These veggies roast quickly, so you can leave them as is (discard the ends of the green beans and woody stems of the asparagus)\n\n• Bell Peppers (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange). Core the peppers and cut into 3/4-inch pieces or 1/2-inch strips.\n\n• Onions (Red, Yellow, or Sweet). Cut off the stem end, then remove the paper and waxy layers. Cut off the root end, then slice the onion in half from end to end. Cut each half lengthwise into about 4 wedges.\n\n• Cherry Tomatoes (or Grape Tomatoes). Leave whole. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper, as the yummy juices will become sticky and caramelize.\n\nTO STORE: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.\nTO REHEAT: Rewarm vegetables on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F or in the microwave.\nTO FREEZE: Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen. Once reheated, frozen roasted vegetables may be a bit soggy, but they will still have great flavor.\n"
