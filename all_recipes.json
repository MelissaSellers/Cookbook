    "recipeText": "1.  For the scones: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.\n\n2.  Sift together the flour, granulated sugar and baking powder. Cut the cold butter into pats, then use a pastry cutter or 2 knives to cut the butter into the flour mixture. Keep going until the mixture is crumbly, then stir in the poppy seeds.\n\n3.  Mix together the heavy cream, lemon extract, water, and egg in a small pitcher. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture with a fork or spatula just until the dough comes together.\n\n4.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle (the mixture will be pretty crumbly). Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12 inches by 7 inches and 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical rectangles, first cutting lengthwise into 3 strips and then across into 4 strips. Next, cut each rectangle in half diagonally, to form 2 triangles. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets.\n\n5.  Bake until cooked through but not yet golden, about 16 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.\n\nBake scones right before you plan to enjoy them. If you'd like to get ahead, you can make and shape the dough into scones ahead of time and leave them in the fridge overnight. Or you can freeze them on a baking sheet, transfer the frozen unbaked scones to a zip-top bag, and bake them straight from frozen, adding a couple of minutes to the baking time\n\n6.  For the lemon glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, lemon zest and juice and salt until completely smooth, adding more milk if needed for thinning.\n\n7.  Dip the scones in the glaze, then sprinkle with poppy seeds. Allow the glaze to set completely before serving.  \n\n*Melissa usually adds 1 extra TBSP cream because this is usually too crumbly and you have to really work the dough to get it to stick."

    "recipeText": "1. Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs.  Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.\n\n2. Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the add-ins, then mix together until everything appears moistened.\n\n3. Put mixture onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. \n\nPress into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 16 wedges. For smaller scones, press dough into two discs and cut each into 16 wedges. \n\n4. Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)\n\n5. Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.\n\n6. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n7. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.\n\n8. Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Larger scones take closer to 25 minutes. \n     Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before topping with optional toppings listed in the ingredients.\n\n9. Leftover scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 days.\n\nBake scones right before you plan to enjoy them. If you'd like to get ahead, you can make and shape the dough into scones ahead of time and leave them in the fridge overnight. Or you can freeze them on a baking sheet, transfer the frozen unbaked scones to a zip-top bag, and bake them straight from frozen, adding a couple of minutes to the baking time."

    "servingSize": "4",

Zucchini has a mild flavor, but roasting it elevates its natural goodness.\n\nSweet Potato. Rich in vitamins and potassium.\n\nRed, Yellow or Sweet Onion.\n\nBroccoli.

    "recipeText": "ROASTING THE VEGETABLES\n\n• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n• If needed, coat baking sheet with non-stick spray. If using a good pan, this is not necessary.\n\n• Place cut vegetables in a great big bowl or zip-top bag.\n\n• Top with oil and sprinkle with seasoning. Toss to coat.\n\n• Pay special attention to the broccoli florets and make sure they get an adequate amount of oil, as they are more prone to burning.\n\n• Spread the vegetables into a single layer with a bit of space. Divide the vegetables evenly between two sheets if needed.\n\n• Roast the vegetables at 400 degrees F. for 25 minutes.\n\n• Toss the vegetables halfway through.\n\n• Enjoy hot or at room temperature, with additional salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\nSEASONINGS\n• Cavender’s Greek Seasoning\n• Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning\n• Garlic - salt, pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic).\n• Italian Seasoning\n• Rosemary\n• Dijon Mustard\n• Parmesan. A finishing sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\n• Spicy - Season with 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder (more if you like super spicy!), or regular chili powder plus cayenne.\n• Cheesy - Sprinkle with freshly grated cheddar, mozzarella, gruyere, or Parmesan cheese. Add after roasting. Pop back into the oven for a few minutes to melt.\n• Citrus - Add thin lemon slices or orange slices to the pan. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or orange juice.\n• Pesto - Reduce the olive oil. Toss the vegetables in store-bought or homemade pesto.\n• Honey - 1 tablespoon honey and an extra pinch of salt. Line your baking sheet with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Curry - Season with curry powder and a touch of cumin.\n• Balsamic - 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar prior to roasting. Line the pan with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Mediterranean - Season with oregano and a touch of red wine vinegar. Add sliced olives to the pan. Sprinkle with feta cheese and top with a squeeze of lemon juice prior to serving.\n\nCUTTING VEGETABLES FOR ROASTING\nIf you are mixing different vegetables on the pan, you will want to make sure they finish cooking in the same amount of time. Here are some tips:\n\n• Round Root Vegetables (Beets, Sweet Potatoes, Potatoes). Cut these vegetables on the smaller size (about 3/4-inch pieces), as they tend to take longer to roast.\n\n• Long Root Vegetables (Carrots, Parsnips). Similarly, these veggies take longer to roast. Cut any thick ones in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch slices.\n\n• Cruciferous Vegetables (Brussels Sprouts, Cauliflower, Broccoli). Cut Brussels sprouts in half, and remove the stems. Cut broccoli and cauliflower stems into small rectangular pieces, and slice florets into pieces that are about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick and 1 1/2- to 2-inches wide.\n\n• Soft Vegetables (Green Beans, Asparagus). These veggies roast quickly, so you can leave them as is (discard the ends of the green beans and woody stems of the asparagus)\n\n• Bell Peppers (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange). Core the peppers and cut into 3/4-inch pieces or 1/2-inch strips.\n\n• Onions (Red, Yellow, or Sweet). Cut off the stem end, then remove the paper and waxy layers. Cut off the root end, then slice the onion in half from end to end. Cut each half lengthwise into about 4 wedges.\n\n• Cherry Tomatoes (or Grape Tomatoes). Leave whole. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper, as the yummy juices will become sticky and caramelize.\n\nTO STORE: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.\nTO REHEAT: Rewarm vegetables on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F or in the microwave.\nTO FREEZE: Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen. Once reheated, frozen roasted vegetables may be a bit soggy, but they will still have great flavor.\n"

Place a metal cooling rack inside a baking sheet and arrange the bread slices on top.\n\nWhen there are about 10 minutes left on the dip, place the bread in the oven alongside the dip to toast. (It's fine to toast on a separate oven if you can't fit both the toasts and the dip on the same rack.)\n\nServe the dip:\nRemove the dip and the toasts from oven. Top the dip with minced chives, stick in a spoon, and serve immediately while hot. Instruct guests to eat by scooping out a bit of the dip with the spoon and topping pieces of toast."

    "servingSize": "8",
    "ingredientList": "Chai Scones:\n12 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter, diced into cubes\n½ cup very cold heavy cream\n2 large eggs, divided\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out scones\n¼ cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1 tablespoon chai spice blend\n½ teaspoon kosher salt\n\nMaple Chai Glaze:\n1 heaping cup powdered sugar\n2 teaspoons chai spice blend\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n3 tablespoons heavy cream\n1 tablespoon maple syrup\npinch of kosher salt",
    "recipeText": "Prep the wet ingredients: Pull the butter, heavy cream, and eggs out of the\nrefrigerator.\n\nButter: Working quickly, dice the butter into 1/4 tablespoon squares. Use mini chopper and mix with some of the flour to quickly dice the butter.\nPlace the diced butter in the freezer.\n\nMeasure the heavy cream into a 2-cup liquid measure, then whisk in 1 large\negg + 1 large egg yolk. (Reserve the remaining egg white for brushing the\nscones.) Set the heavy cream mixture in the freezer to chill while you\nmeasure out the dry ingredients.\n\nPrep the dry ingredients: In the bowl of a food processor combine the flour,\nsugar, baking powder, chai spices, & kosher salt. Pulse a handful of times to\nquickly bring the mixture together.\n\nAdd the wet ingredients: Pull the butter out of the freezer and add it to the flour mixture in the food processor. Pulse it into the flour until the butter begins to cut into the flour mixture, about 25-30 pulses. Some pieces of butter will be very small and coated with flour (it will look like fluffy parmesan cheese!), and some pieces of butter will still be large, which is ideal for a tender, flaky scone. Pull the cream & egg mixture out of the freezer. Slowly and gradually pulse it into the butter & flour mixture, until the dough just forms a ball and starts to pull away from the sides of the food processor. The dough should be slightly wet to the touch, with pieces of butter still visible. You may not need to use all of the cream mixture – that’s okay!\n\nNotes\nRest the dough: Transfer the scone dough to a lightly floured surface. Working quickly, form it into a ball and press it into a disc. The dough may break apart a little bit, and that’s fine! Just work quickly to get it into another ball, then pat it down into a disc. Wrap the dough in plastic & transfer it to the freezer to rest for 30 minutes.\n\nRoll out the scones: Remove the scone dough from the freezer, placing it on a\nlightly floured surface. For full-sized scones, roll the dough into a circle, 1 inch thick. Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to cut the dough into 8 wedges. For mini scones, roll the dough into a rectangle, 1/2-inch thick. Cut the rectangle into strips, about 2 inches wide. Slice each strip into smaller triangles, 2 inches wide & 3 inches long.\n\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment\npaper or a Silpat baking mat. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet & brush generously with the egg wash.\n\nBake the scones for 20-22 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven &\nallow to cool before glazing.\n\nMake the maple chai glaze: Meanwhile, as the scones bake, combine powdered\nsugar, chai spice, vanilla extract, heavy cream, maple syrup & salt in a small bowl. Whisk until combined into a thick glaze.\n\nGlaze the scones: Submerge the top of a scone into the glaze, generously\ncoating each scone. I like to glaze the scones once, let them set up for a little bit, then glaze them a second time, in order to get a very thick layer of glaze. Let the glaze set up for 10 minutes or so before serving the scones. \n\nStorage: Homemade chai scones will keep, stored in an airtight container at\nroom temperature for up to 3 days.\n\nFreezing: These chai scones are also incredibly freezer-friendly. To freeze:\narrange on a baking sheet & flash freeze until chilled through. Transfer to an airtight freezer container or bag & store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature.\n\nMake-ahead: One of my favorite hostess tricks is baking fresh scones for guests using dough I’ve made ahead of time. Major wow factor! To make-ahead,\nprepare & roll out the chai scones according to Steps 1-5, above. Arrange on a baking sheet & flash freeze the scone dough, until firm. Once firm, transfer to an airtight freezer container or bag & store in the freezer for up to 3 months. To bake fresh scones, thaw the dough out overnight in the refrigerator. Bake & glaze according to Steps 6-9 – easy!"

Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half for them to fit into the pan).\n\nCover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours. We like to check the ribs after 2 hours to see how they are progressing. The ribs are done when the meat is cooked through and tender.\n\n\nMAKE BARBECUE SAUCE\nWhile the ribs bake, make the barbecue sauce.

Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.\n\nTO FINISH\nRemove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.\nOptional: Move an oven rack near the top of the oven. Turn broiler to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs while they broil so the sauce does not burn.)\n\n\nNOTES:\nLow and slow cooking make these oven-baked ribs fall off the bone tender. For the most tender ribs, we remove the thin membrane covering the back of the rack. \n\nFor the most tender ribs, we remove the thin membrane covering the rack. It can be a bit tough when cooked, and since we love ribs that fall of the bone, the membrane has to go. You might find that the butcher has already removed this, but just in case, here’s how to do it yourself.\nTo remove it, gently slide a knife under the membrane, and then use your fingers to pull the membrane away from the bones. If it is slippery or difficult to remove, use a kitchen towel to take hold of it and pull.\n\n\nFAQ: We call for baby back ribs in the recipe, but other types of ribs (spareribs, country-style, St. Louis-style) will work with this recipe. \n\n\n"

Add the diced onions, celery, and carrots and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.\n\n2. Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes, until the flour begins to turn a golden color.\n\n3. Add the chicken broth and half and half in splashes, stirring to incorporate. Don’t add it too quickly or you will break the roux.\n\n4. Add the thyme and mustard powder.\n\n5. If using uncooked chicken, add it to the broth. Bring it to a gentle boil. (If you boil too rapidly, the chicken will become tough.) Simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. (This depends on the thickness of the chicken.)\n\n6. Remove the chicken and let it rest for 5 minutes, then dice it and add it back to the soup. Let the soup simmer until desired consistency is obtained, it will continue to thicken.\n\n7. Add the gnocchi and simmer for about 5 minutes, refer to package instructions for exact amount of time.\n\n8. Reduce heat to low and add the spinach, red pepper flakes, and any salt/pepper to taste. Simmer until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute. Serve!\n\nNotes\nThe soup will continue to thicken the longer that it simmers on the stove top.\n\nSliced or Ground Sausage can be used instead of chicken and it can be cooked with the vegetables as they soften.\n\nHalf and Half is half milk, half cream.\n\nMustard Powder is an ingredient that I like to use that you can't taste outright in the soup, but it helps enhance the other flavors.\n\nCrock Pot Method:\nNote: We'll use a slurry to thicken the soup at the end, so omit the flour and only use 1 Tbsp. butter. The consistency of the Crock Pot method isn't quite as thick as the stove top but it still tastes great.\n\nCut uncooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Melt the butter over low heat in the Crock Pot.\n\nAdd the vegetables, garlic, and chicken and toss to coat. Pour in the chicken broth and stir in the thyme and mustard powder. Do not add the half and half, gnocchi, or spinach.\n\nCook on low for 6-8 hours. Use a fork to whisk the half and half and 2 Tablespoons cornstarch until combined. Slowly stir it into the soup. Add the gnocchi. Increase heat to high and cook for 30 minutes, until the gnocchi is cooked through.\n\nAdd the spinach a few minutes prior to serving.

    "recipeText": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWash 3-4 large peaches and chop them into bite sized pieces or slices (you'll need about 2 and a half cups of chopped or thinly sliced peaches to cover the cake.). Set them aside in a bowl while you prepare the cake batter.\n\nAdd the butter and the sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer and beat them together until the mixture is fluffy and becomes a pale colour (about 4-5 minutes). It's important that the butter is at room temperature before you begin. This will allow it to integrate properly with the other wet ingredients.\nFeel free to use a hand mixer if you prefer.\n\nAdd the eggs and the vanilla and beat them in on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It's a good idea to scrape down the bowl periodically to make sure everything is incorporated evenly.\n\nAdd the milk and sour cream and beat in these ingredients on low speed until they're combined.\n\nTo a separate bowl add the flour, the baking powder and the salt and mix these ingredients together with a fork or a wire whisk. Once they're all incorporated, dump the flour mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer with the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and watch the batter come together. As soon as you see the batter form with streaks of flour throughout, turn off the mixer and remove the bowl.\n\nOver-mixing at this stage can cause an overly dense and dry cake with large air bubbles, which you definitely don't want. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl by hand and gently fold in the remaining flour. Be sure to stop folding as soon as everything is combined.\n\nGrease a 9x13 rectangular glass cake pan (or a metal pan) with some butter and pour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to push the batter into the corners and even out the surface. Don't worry, the batter will seem thick but it's supposed to be like that.\n\nSpread the peaches over the top of the batter.\n\nIn a clean bowl mix together the flour, sugar and cinnamon for the streusel topping. Add in the melted butter and mix everything together with a fork until the mixture becomes crumbly.\n\nSprinkle the streusel mixture over the cake and the peaches, making sure to spread it at evenly as possible and into all the corners.\n\nBake the cake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 47-50 minutes. When it's finished baking the topping will be slightly browned on top, the fruit will be bubbly, and when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake it will come out clean.\n\nLet the cake cool for at least 25 minutes before slicing."

Do not over mix the dough or the scones will be tough.\n\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead the dough four or five times. Pat the dough into a 7-inch round circle.\n\nCut the circle in half, then cut each half into four triangle-shaped wedges. Arrange the scones 2 inches apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the scones in the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\nPosition the oven rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of the scones with cream. \nBake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and drizzle with glaze. Scones are best enjoyed right away.\n\n\n\nNotes\nDon't add all the liquid at once. Depending on the humidity and the brand of flour you are using, you may need less liquid than what is called for. Add just enough to moisten the dry ingredients until they hold together when squeezed.\n\nDice the pear into small pieces. Smaller pieces will make it easier to cut the dough into triangles.\n\nMake sure butter and milk are cold when adding it to the recipe.\n\nFreeze the shaped scones for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the scones keep their shape and ensures the butter isn't too warm before going into the oven.\n\nThis recipe yields 8 large scones. For smaller scones, cut the dough into 16 pieces instead of 8. Watch the scones closely as they bake because smaller scones may require a shorter baking time.\n\nMake Ahead Tip\nYou can refrigerate the dough overnight then simply shape the scones and bake them the next day.\nThe dough can also be frozen for up to 2 months. Freeze the dough on a baking sheet as directed in step 5 then wrap in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag. When ready to make the scones, preheat the oven and baked as directed. There's no need to thaw the dough.\nYou can keep leftover scones for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.\nUnglazed scones can be frozen for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight then reheat and glaze before serving.\n\nButtermilk is a favored product in high altitude baking because it contribute acidity as well as richness, moisture, flavor, and tenderness. If a sea-level recipe calls for regular milk, you can replace it with buttermilk. Acidity weakens the elasticity and/or strength of gluten in wheat flour, thereby keeping baked products tender."

Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture with a fork or spatula just until the dough comes together.\n\n4.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle (the mixture will be pretty crumbly). Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12 inches by 7 inches and 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical rectangles, first cutting lengthwise into 3 strips and then across into 4 strips. Next, cut each rectangle in half diagonally, to form 2 triangles.

    "recipeName": "Freeze Basil Leaves",
    "recipeDescription": "",
    "servingSize": "",
    "ingredientList": "",
    "recipeText": "If you stick a bunch of basil leaves in the freezer without any preparation, those leaves are going to turn brown and mushy as soon as you pull them out. Basically, the freezer pauses the decomposition process, but then it fast forwards the minute those leaves feel warm air again.\nIt is possible to freeze basil leaves without them getting all nasty. It just takes a little prep work. \n\nYou can blanch them, mix them with oil, or make basil pesto. Then you freeze. All of these methods are fast and easy. They require just 10 to 20 minutes of your time and a couple supplies.\nLet's look at each of these methods.\n\n\nBlanch Basil Leaves\nThe blanching process kills off the microorganisms that cause decomposition. It's the best way to ensure leaves from your garden retain both their nice green color and flavor after being frozen.\n\nHOW TO BLANCH BASIL LEAVES\nFill a large bowl with ice water. Bring a large pot of water to boil.\n\nDip your basil stems into the boiling water for a few seconds. Your goal is not to cook the leaves (that'll get rid of some of the flavor)—just to wilt them.\n\nDunk the stems in the ice water immediately after to stop the cooking process.\n\nOnce your leaves are blanched, you just have to pat them dry with a towel and then strip them from the stems. Transfer the leaves to a freezer-safe bag (avoid bunching the leaves up in the bag) and place in the freezer.\n\nNow you have frozen basil leaves ready to add to the very end of your cooking time when you're making pasta or pizza!\n\n\nPreserve Basil in Olive Oil\nOlive oil is a wonderful preservative because it prevents the growth of those microorganisms that cause decay. To preserve your basil leaves in olive oil, you just need a high-quality olive oil (I recommend extra virgin olive oil) and an ice cube tray.\n\nHOW TO MAKE FROZEN BASIL CUBES\nI recommend blanching the basil leaves first, but it's optional. Make sure to at least wash your leaves and then pat them dry with a kitchen towel.\n\nStrip the leaves from the stems. My trick is to hold the top part of a stem and rub my hands downward. This method works for herbs like basil, thyme, and oregano, and the thicker the stem, the easier it is to pull those leaves off quickly.\n\nChop the basil leaves into small pieces. Cutting releases the oils and the flavor and also makes it easier to save your herbs. Your pieces don't need to be precise. Saving the flavor of summer is what matters here, not making it look pretty.\n\nStuff as much basil as you can into each little cube.\n\nFill each cube to the top with olive oil (or at least make sure all the leaves are covered so they'll freeze). Again, the goal is not to look pretty. The goal is flavor, and that you shall have.\n\nStick your tray in the freezer.\n\nOnce the cubes are frozen, pop them out and store them in a freezer-safe baggie, Tupperware, or jar.\n\nWhenever you're craving basil, all you have to do is open your freezer, pull out a cube, and toss it in a pan to melt on the stove. Boom! You'll be transported to summer, and your dish will taste so fresh and gourmet.\nToss you basil cubes on pasta, grilled or baked chicken, tomato soup—any cooked dish that calls for basil. Your kitchen will smell like you're in the middle of July, even though it's January.\n\nTIP:\nThis method also works well with other soft herbs like cilantro, parsley, dill, and even chives.\n\n\nFreeze Basil Pesto\nPesto freezes really well thanks to the olive oil inside. If you have a couple basil plants, you can easily make enough pesto to last you all winter long.\n\nHOW TO FREEZE BASIL PESTO\nBlanch your basil leaves to preserve the green color. Otherwise, wash your leaves and pat them dry.\n\nUse a food processor to whip up your favorite pesto recipe. I toss about 3 cups basil leaves in with roasted pine nuts or almonds, a couple garlic cloves, grated parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Blitz the ingredients in a food processor until you have a spreadable paste.\n\nSpread your pesto into an ice cube tray (or a nonstick muffin pan, if you'd like larger servings).\n\nStick your tray in the freezer.\n\nOnce the pesto cubes are frozen, pop them out and store them in a freezer-safe baggie, Tupperware, or jar.\n\nPull a cube out and melt it over warm pasta for a cozy meal on a cold night. If you're feeling adventurous, add your pesto to pizza, grilled vegetables, or even egg-based dishes for breakfast.\n\n"

    "recipeText": "ROASTING THE VEGETABLES\n\n• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n• If needed, coat baking sheet with non-stick spray. If using a good pan, this is not necessary.\n\n• Place cut vegetables in a great big bowl or zip-top bag.\n\n• Top with oil and sprinkle with seasoning. Toss to coat.\n\n• Pay special attention to the broccoli florets and make sure they get an adequate amount of oil, as they are more prone to burning.\n\n• Spread the vegetables into a single layer with a bit of space. Divide the vegetables evenly between two sheets if needed.\n\n• Roast the vegetables at 400 degrees F. for 25 minutes.\n\n• Toss the vegetables halfway through.\n\n• Enjoy hot or at room temperature, with additional salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\nSEASONINGS\n• Cavender’s Greek Seasoning\n• Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning\n• Garlic - salt, pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic).\n• Italian Seasoning\n• Rosemary\n• Dijon Mustard\n• Parmesan. A finishing sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\n• Spicy - Season with 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder (more if you like super spicy!), or regular chili powder plus cayenne.\n• Cheesy - Sprinkle with freshly grated cheddar, mozzarella, gruyere, or Parmesan cheese. Add after roasting. Pop back into the oven for a few minutes to melt.\n• Citrus - Add thin lemon slices or orange slices to the pan. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or orange juice.\n• Pesto - Reduce the olive oil. Toss the vegetables in store-bought or homemade pesto.\n• Honey - 1 tablespoon honey and an extra pinch of salt. Line your baking sheet with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Curry - Season with curry powder and a touch of cumin.\n• Balsamic - 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar prior to roasting. Line the pan with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Mediterranean - Season with oregano and a touch of red wine vinegar. Add sliced olives to the pan. Sprinkle with feta cheese and top with a squeeze of lemon juice prior to serving.\n\nCUTTING VEGETABLES FOR ROASTING\nIf you are mixing different vegetables on the pan, you will want to make sure they finish cooking in the same amount of time. Here are some tips:\n\n• Round Root Vegetables (Beets, Sweet Potatoes, Potatoes). Cut these vegetables on the smaller size (about 3/4-inch pieces), as they tend to take longer to roast.\n\n• Long Root Vegetables (Carrots, Parsnips). Similarly, these veggies take longer to roast. Cut any thick ones in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch slices.\n\n• Cruciferous Vegetables (Brussels Sprouts, Cauliflower, Broccoli). Cut Brussels sprouts in half, and remove the stems. Cut broccoli and cauliflower stems into small rectangular pieces, and slice florets into pieces that are about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick and 1 1/2- to 2-inches wide.\n\n• Soft Vegetables (Green Beans, Asparagus). These veggies roast quickly, so you can leave them as is (discard the ends of the green beans and woody stems of the asparagus)\n\n• Bell Peppers (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange). Core the peppers and cut into 3/4-inch pieces or 1/2-inch strips.\n\n• Onions (Red, Yellow, or Sweet). Cut off the stem end, then remove the paper and waxy layers. Cut off the root end, then slice the onion in half from end to end. Cut each half lengthwise into about 4 wedges.\n\n• Cherry Tomatoes (or Grape Tomatoes). Leave whole. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper, as the yummy juices will become sticky and caramelize.\n\nTO STORE: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.\nTO REHEAT: Rewarm vegetables on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F or in the microwave.\nTO FREEZE: Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen. Once reheated, frozen roasted vegetables may be a bit soggy, but they will still have great flavor.\n"

Then put the cheese in a cheese cloth and squeeze and twist out all the moisture. Rinse the outside of the cloth, squeeze again, then open the cloth to get the cottage cheese out. \n\n** Other recipes say you can use a full egg in the cottage cheese mix. Use 3/4 to 1 cup of cottage cheese, 3 TBSP sugar, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.\n\n** Some recipes suggest 1/2 tsp. baking powder.\n\n** Drop 'buttons' carefully into boiling water for about 5 minutes. These dumplings float when they are done cooking. Drain.\n\n** I a large saucepan, melt some butter; add buttons, making sure to have only one layer. Brown lightly on both sides. \n\n**Melissa found an alternate recipe online called \"vareniki\" or \"varenyky\" which is a Ukrainian word meaning \"boiled thing\" and refers to a type of dumpling.  The recipe calls for 3 eggs, 16 oz of dry cottage cheese (or ricotta cheese), 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1/2 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 cups flour.  Beat 3 eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy.  Add dry cottage cheese.  Add sugar and salt; mix.  Slowly add flour until dough is workable.  Roll out and cut into 1\" pieces.  Put in boiling water and let water come to a boil again.  Cook about 10 minutes, drain, and add butter on top.)"

Then put the cheese in a cheese cloth and squeeze and twist out all the moisture. Rinse the outside of the cloth, squeeze again, then open the cloth to get the cottage cheese out. \n\n** Other recipes say you can use a full egg in the cottage cheese mix. Use 3/4 to 1 cup of cottage cheese, 3 TBSP sugar, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.\n\n** Some recipes suggest 1/2 tsp. baking powder.\n\n** Drop 'buttons' carefully into boiling water for about 5 minutes. These dumplings float when they are done cooking. Drain.\n\n** I a large saucepan, melt some butter; add buttons, making sure to have only one layer. Brown lightly on both sides. \n\n**Melissa found an alternate recipe online called \"vareniki\" or \"varenyky\" which is a Ukrainian word meaning \"boiled thing\" and refers to a type of dumpling.  The recipe calls for 3 eggs, 16 oz of dry cottage cheese (or ricotta cheese), 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1/2 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 cups flour.  Beat 3 eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy.  Add dry cottage cheese.  Add sugar and salt; mix.  Slowly add flour until dough is workable.  Roll out and cut into 1\" pieces.  Put in boiling water and let water come to a boil again.  Cook about 10 minutes, drain, and add butter on top.)"
