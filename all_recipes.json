    "recipeText": "Make The Scones\nIn a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom together.\n\nCut the butter into the flour using a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingertips. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Gently fold in the pears.\n\nWhisk the vanilla and buttermilk together and gradually add it to the flour mixture. Stir just until the dough comes together. You may not need all the buttermilk. Add a little at a time until the mixture is moist but not too wet. Do not over mix the dough or the scones will be tough.\n\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead the dough four or five times. Pat the dough into a 7-inch round circle.\n\nCut the circle in half, then cut each half into four triangle-shaped wedges. Arrange the scones 2 inches apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the scones in the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\nPosition the oven rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400°F. Brush the tops of the scones with cream.\n\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and drizzle with glaze. Scones are best enjoyed right away.\n\n\n\nNotes\nDon't add all the liquid at once. Depending on the humidity and the brand of flour you are using, you may need less liquid than what is called for. Add just enough to moisten the dry ingredients until they hold together when squeezed.\nDice the pear into small pieces. Smaller pieces will make it easier to cut the dough into triangles.\nMake sure butter and milk are cold when adding it to the recipe.\nFreeze the shaped scones for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the scones keep their shape and ensures the butter isn't too warm before going into the oven.\nThis recipe yields 8 large scones. For smaller scones, cut the dough into 16 pieces instead of 8. Watch the scones closely as they bake because smaller scones may require a shorter baking time.\nMake Ahead Tip\nYou can refrigerate the dough overnight then simply shape the scones and bake them the next day.\nThe dough can also be frozen for up to 2 months. Freeze the dough on a baking sheet as directed in step 5 then wrap in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag. When ready to make the scones, preheat the oven and baked as directed. There's no need to thaw the dough.\nYou can keep leftover scones for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.\nUnglazed scones can be frozen for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight then reheat and glaze before serving.\n\nButtermilk is a favored product in high altitude baking because it contribute acidity as well as richness, moisture, flavor, and tenderness. If a sea-level recipe calls for regular milk, you can replace it with buttermilk. Acidity weakens the elasticity and/or strength of gluten in wheat flour, thereby keeping baked products tender."
