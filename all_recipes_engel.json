    "recipeText": "Before starting, place beef in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes. This will make it easier to slice.\n\nThinly slice the onion and peppers.  Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil to a large, deep (14-inch) sauté pan and place over MEDIUM-LOW heat. Add onion and bell peppers. Allow to cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender. If they are beginning to brown, turn the heat down a bit. \n\nUse a sharp knife to trim excess fat from the steak and then slice it as thinly as possible across the grain. Chop the sliced steak into very small pieces; you want little ¼-inch pieces.  Season the meat with the Lawry's seasoning and minced garlic. \n\nIn a separate skillet, add oil and place over MEDIUM-HIGH heat. Add half of the chopped steak and cook, stirring frequently, for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until no pink remains.\n\nTransfer the first batch of steak with a slotted spoon to the skillet with fully cooked onions and peppers.  Do not transfer the juice!  Add additional oil, if needed, and repeat with remaining steak.\n\nPlace 7 provolone slices over the mixture in a circle and cover the pan. Cook on MEDIUM until cheese melts, about 4 to 5 minutes, then stir. \n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nSplit open the hoagies rolls and place them on a baking sheet.  Butter the rolls.  Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly golden and toasted.\n\nUse tongs to transfer meat mixture to the toasted sandwich rolls.\n\nGarnish sandwich with Franks Hot Sauce. \n\nYou can substitute cream cheese in place of the provolone cheese and add pickled jalapeno peppers for a Hot Popper Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich. \n\t\t\t",

    "recipeText": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWash 3-4 large peaches and chop them into bite sized pieces or slices (you'll need about 2 and a half cups of chopped or thinly sliced peaches to cover the cake.). Set them aside in a bowl while you prepare the cake batter.\n\nAdd the butter and the sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer and beat them together until the mixture is fluffy and becomes a pale colour (about 4-5 minutes). It's important that the butter is at room temperature before you begin. This will allow it to integrate properly with the other wet ingredients.\nFeel free to use a hand mixer if you prefer.\n\nAdd the eggs and the vanilla and beat them in on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It's a good idea to scrape down the bowl periodically to make sure everything is incorporated evenly.\n\nAdd the milk and sour cream and beat in these ingredients on low speed until they're combined.\n\nTo a separate bowl add the flour, the baking powder and the salt and mix these ingredients together with a fork or a wire whisk. Once they're all incorporated, dump the flour mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer with the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and watch the batter come together. As soon as you see the batter form with streaks of flour throughout, turn off the mixer and remove the bowl.\n\nOver-mixing at this stage can cause an overly dense and dry cake with large air bubbles, which you definitely don't want. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl by hand and gently fold in the remaining flour. Be sure to stop folding as soon as everything is combined.\n\nGrease a 9x13 rectangular glass cake pan (or a metal pan) with some butter and pour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to push the batter into the corners and even out the surface. Don't worry, the batter will seem thick but it's supposed to be like that.\n\nSpread the peaches over the top of the batter.\n\nIn a clean bowl mix together the flour, sugar and cinnamon for the streusel topping. Add in the melted butter and mix everything together with a fork until the mixture becomes crumbly.\n\nSprinkle the streusel mixture over the cake and the peaches, making sure to spread it at evenly as possible and into all the corners.\n\nBake the cake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 47-50 minutes. When it's finished baking the topping will be slightly browned on top, the fruit will be bubbly, and when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake it will come out clean.\n\nLet the cake cool for at least 25 minutes before slicing.",

Set aside.\n\nIn a large bowl using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and beat on high speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the maple syrup, vanilla extract, and maple extract, then beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and beat on low speed until combined. Add the pecans and beat on low speed until just incorporated. Dough will be creamy and soft.\n\nCover the dough and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours (and up to 3 days). \n\nPreheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) If the dough has chilled for longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before shaping the cookies.\n\nScoop and roll cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons (35g) of dough per cookie. Arrange the cookies 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.\n\nBake for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned and set but the centers still look very soft. Cool the cookies on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.\n\n\nMake the icing: \nIn a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with the maple syrup, whisking occasionally. Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and whisk in the sifted confectioners’ sugar and salt. Taste. Drizzle over the cooled cookies. Icing will set after about 1 hour.

Add hash browns and mix well. \n\nSpoon potato mixture into prepared pan(s).\n\nTop with crushed crackers and remaining 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nBake, uncovered, for 45 to 50 minutes, until bubbly.\n\nNotes:\nCan assemble casserole ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze for later.\nTo bake after freezing, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed above.",
